# esp32-iot

A iot project based on esp32 microcontroller. Repository contains two folders for different sensors and actuators.
You can get from sensors and can push that data to server using mqtt protocol. Similarely, Actuators commands can be sent from the server using
mqtt. 

You can use any mqtt broker. Here, I have used broker from "hivemq". 

## Temeperature and Humidity (DHT11 sensor), Motion Detection(PIR sensor), Smoke Detection (MQ2 sensor), RFID and MQTT .
